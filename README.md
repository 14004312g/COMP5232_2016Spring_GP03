# Overview

This simple PHP application demonstrates how to connect to a MySQL service on Bluemix. This application allows the user to create a new table, and enter records into the database using the UI.

Note: The `mysql` service used by this sample is in the [Bluemix Labs Catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/labs/). It can also be used with ClearDB, with minor changes to db.php
